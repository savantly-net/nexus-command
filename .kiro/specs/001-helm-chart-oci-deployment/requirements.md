# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automated packaging and deployment of the Nexus Command Helm chart to Docker Hub using OCI (Open Container Initiative) compatibility. The system will automatically package and push the Helm chart as an OCI artifact when git tags are pushed, enabling seamless distribution and versioning of the Helm chart alongside the application Docker images.

## Glossary

- **GitHub_Actions_System**: The CI/CD automation platform that executes workflows on repository events
- **Helm_Chart**: A collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources
- **OCI_Registry**: A registry that supports the Open Container Initiative specification for storing container images and artifacts
- **Docker_Hub**: The OCI registry service where both Docker images and Helm charts will be stored
- **Git_Tag**: A reference point in Git history used to mark release versions
- **Chart_Package**: A compressed archive (.tgz) containing the Helm chart files and metadata

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Helm charts to be automatically packaged and published when I create a git tag, so that I can distribute versioned charts alongside application releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a git tag is pushed to the repository, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL trigger the Helm chart packaging workflow
2. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL package the Helm chart located in the helm/nexus-command directory into a Chart_Package
3. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL push the Chart_Package to Docker_Hub as an OCI artifact using the same repository namespace as the Docker images
4. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL tag the Chart_Package with the same version as the git tag
5. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL authenticate with Docker_Hub using the existing repository secrets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to pull Helm charts from Docker Hub using standard Helm OCI commands, so that I can deploy applications using the published charts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chart_Package SHALL be stored in Docker_Hub with the repository path savantly/nexus-command-helm
2. THE Chart_Package SHALL be accessible using the helm pull oci:// command syntax
3. THE Chart_Package SHALL include all necessary chart files including templates, values.yaml, and Chart.yaml
4. THE Chart_Package SHALL preserve all chart dependencies and metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want the workflow to only run on git tag pushes and not on regular commits, so that chart publishing is controlled and aligned with official releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL only execute the Helm chart workflow when a git tag is pushed
2. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL not execute the Helm chart workflow on branch pushes or pull requests
3. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL support both lightweight and annotated git tags
4. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL handle multiple tags pushed simultaneously by processing each tag individually

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback when the Helm chart deployment fails, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the Chart_Package creation fails, THEN THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL provide detailed error logs
2. IF the Docker_Hub authentication fails, THEN THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL report authentication errors without exposing credentials
3. IF the OCI push operation fails, THEN THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL report the specific failure reason
4. THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL set the workflow status to failed when any step in the Helm chart deployment process fails
